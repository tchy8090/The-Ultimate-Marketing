    <div class="col-md-7">Developing a marketing strategy fully depends on how well you understand your target market and where they spend most of their time online. Depending on your customer base, you may choose to use any (or all) of these types of marketing.

Blog Marketing – What started out as a creative outlet for writers and artists has since turned into an effective marketing strategy for businesses the world over. Most of content marketing today involves writing and publishing blog posts either on the brand’s website or other websites that share a similar target audience. The main goal is to increase your reach by making more content than just the products you sell available to your target audience.
Internet Marketing – Internet marketing, which largely overlaps with digital marketing, is the very idea of putting your business online simply to become more available to your customers. In 2020, the competitive advantage is not what you offer, but how available you are online.
Print Marketing – More traditional marketing still uses print media to reach their target audience by employing ull advertising campaigns and guest features in magazines and newspapers that the target audience reads.
Search Engine Optimization – Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a marketing process that focuses on boosting a website’s rankings on search engines, including Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The idea is to get a website in front of the eyes of a potential customer as they search for a product or service that you offer. When done well, it can keep your advertising campaign spend low and keep your sales high.
Social Media Marketing – With so many people using social media for hours each day, many businesses are turning to their favorite social media channels to reach their target audience. Besides developing your own marketing tactics on social media, influencer marketing is another powerful way to reach potential customers through social media marketing.
Video Marketing – Recent technological advances have made it easier than ever to produce quality videos for basically no money. Considering that almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every day, it makes sense that some companies would want to put some marketing effort into videos as well.
